# Role of logs as natural bridges across tropical streams

This repository contains companion data and code for analyses of the manuscript entitled "Fallen logs act as natural bridges over rivers in a tropical wet forest", by J.S. Vargas Soto et al. 
In the manuscript we describe the different species that use logs spanning streams in a tropical rainforest, and analyze factors that influence the frequency of use and probability of crossing.
